# Sports Blog
<hr>

## General info
I created a profile on medium to share my passion for sports analytics and data-driven insights.

As a student pursuing my Masters degree, I'm fascinated by the new wave of data and analytics transforming the world of sports. Through my blogs, I aim generate discussions
by analyzing sports data. My process typically involves finding relevant datasets on sites like Kaggle. I'll then clean, organize and visualize the data to uncover stories
that maybe weren't obvious at first glance. My goal is to offer a fresh and analytical perspective on the games we love.

Above all, I started this profile to satisfy my curiosity about sports from a numbers viewpoint. I'm excited to share insights, get feedback, 
and continue honing my data skills. Please feel free to comment on any posts and discuss the improvements that I can make.
